# MachineLearning
 In this repo, I will share my machine learning journey. I picked the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9_4yMHFhI&list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF">statquest playlist </a> for getting the theoretical backgorund with the fun of learning.

 _Screenshots will be updated and soon_


 ## A Gentle Introduction to Machine Learning
 ### A simple decision tree

    - Decision trees are being used for classification. In general, they are resorted for prediction and classification. Well, the main idea behind the machine learning is making predictions and classifications. This is not a special case for decision trees.

### Simple Linear Regression

 - This guy up here is a simple linear regression example. We can basically predict a person's speed by looking at the amount of yam s/he eats. The black dotted line is our model.

 - Dont forget, our aim is to predict, not overfitting!! Eun away from the _Bias-VAriance Tradeoff_

<strong>Terminology:</strong>
- Training data: the original data
- Testing data: new data that we can check our model's performance


## Cross Validation
- A comparison method that allows us to compare different machine learning methods and let us see which one will serve us the best.

    -   Four-Fold Cross Validation (25% - 75%)
    -   Leave One Out Cross Validaion (1% - 99%) _not really popular_
    -   Ten-fold cross validation (%10 - 90%) _popular kid_
